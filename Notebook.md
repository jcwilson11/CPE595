01 - 27 - 25 : Week 1

Intro to Machine Learning 
- relation to fancy words
  - Artificial Intelligience (AI): most borad field, 1950s, meant to mimic human intelligience
  - Machine Learning (ML): sub category of AU, 1980s, an approach to achieve AI, focusing on specific tasks
  - Deep Learning (DL): A technique for implementing ML, 2010s

- Currently, chatGPT is one of the best public representations of how powerful machine learning and its techniqeus are, allowing it to have superb natural language processing (NLP), as if we were having a conversatikon with our friends or family. 

- Already applicable in autonomous vehicles, finance, and healthcare system

- what exactly is machine learning
  - Arthur Samuel (1959; known as the founder of AI): MAchine learning is the field of study that gives the computer the ability to learn without explicitily being programmed. 

AAI/CPE 595 Week 1 Notes

Taxonomy of Machine Learning
	- Supervised Learning
	- Unsupervised Learning
	- Reinforced Learning
supervised:
- most common
- learns from existing data
- existing data allows it to make predictions
- ex: if a house has x square feet, give an estimation in price y
- task: find a function/hypothesis h that maps features/inputs to a target/output

regression vs classification: two types of supervised learning 
	- regression: the target y is a continuous variable (eg, house price prediction)
	- classification: the target is a discrete value (eg, house type)

multiple features can be given for x in order to give an estimation y
	- picking features is very important 

supervised learning in computer vision
- image classification
	- x = raw pixels of the images
	- y = bounded boxes of the target


unsupervised
training sets no longer contain target values, meaning there is no need for human intervention
clustering
	- grouping data based on similarities 
association
	- find relationships between different variables in large-scale datasets 
	- frequently used in recommendation engines
